# Twitch App
### Is the apk trustworthy?
Yes, my full name is in my [portfolio](https://stringmanolo.github.io/portfolio/#about). I wouldn't share a virus using a github account linked to my full name.

### Is this a special/custom app?
No, is the official Twitch app extracted from my smartphone. (I didn't updated it to the tiktok version)

### Is this repo realated to twitch or twitch developers?
No, i'm just a random software developer that like to watch educative content on Twitch and funny stuff. Just a regular user.

### Is secure to use an outdated app?
Today? Yes. In a month? Most likelly. In a year? Probably not unless someone extract the security patches from the new app to patch this version manually.

### Will Twitch allow this version to keep working?
No idea. If they force to update to the new version, i can patch it to make it work again. In that case, i will upload another version of the apk or make my own Twitch client.
